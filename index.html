    <h3>Statement on Playlistdeposit</h3>
    <p>Throughout this project, I originally wanted to create a website using the Spotify web API that allows you to sort out the songs you listen to depending on the artist and how often you listen to it from a week, months and over a year. 
        This is the original concept that I had in mind but eventually was scared because I had challenges with trying to code the API. 
        As a result, I decided to upload the website still since I wanted to highlight my first attempt at approaching the project. 
        By doing this, I wanted to highlight the many attempts and failures that I had with the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        My second attempt at this project was to still use the Spotify API but use it so that you are able to save a playlist locally using JSON. 
        Although I did try to attempt to create this website, I was not successful in creating the website and faced many issues with trying to connect the API to the Spotify website. 
        I also decided to upload this fact because I wanted to highlight that this was a great learning experience with me trying to reteach myself by using an API. By posting some of my screenshots, 
        I hope that I can document my experience with this project.  
    </p>
    <p>
        So what did I learn through this project? One instance is that APIs are hard to code with. Even with this being my second attempt at trying to learn how to use an API, I still have a hard time trying to code. Although the goal of my project did
        not go through, I am still very satisfied with the progress that I made with working on this project.
